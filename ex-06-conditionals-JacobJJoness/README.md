## Boolean Expressions and if Statements

Algorithms are composed of three building blocks:
* sequencing
* selection
* iteration

This unit will focus on selection, which is represented in a program by using conditional statements.  Conditional statements give the program the ability to decide and respond appropriately and are a critical aspect of any nontrivial computer program.

## Assignments

This unit is going to be comprised of some practice problems on CodingBat, and some smaller programming projects from a website, *Programming by Doing*.

### 1. Read
* Start by reading CodingBat's take on [Java If and Boolean Logic](https://codingbat.com/doc/java-if-boolean-logic.html).

### 2. Practice
* Complete the problems under [Logic 1](https://codingbat.com/java/Logic-1) on CodingBat.

### 3. Program
Complete the following mini-projects on *Programming by Doing*.  Be sure to save the Java files using the names in the assignments and add/commit/push them as you finish each.
* [Asking Questions](http://www.programmingbydoing.com/a/asking-questions.html)
* [Name, Age, and Salary](http://www.programmingbydoing.com/a/name-age-and-salary.html)
* [How Old are You?](https://programmingbydoing.com/a/how-old-are-you.html)
* [How Old are You, Specifically?](https://programmingbydoing.com/a/how-old-are-you-elseif.html)
* [Modulus Animation](https://programmingbydoing.com/a/modulus-animation.html) (this one is pretty cool)
* [Twenty Questions...](https://programmingbydoing.com/a/twenty-questions.html)
* [Two More Questions](https://programmingbydoing.com/a/two-more-questions.html)
